\title{Download satellite ocean colour data}
\usage{
get_erddap_data(
  dataset_id = "bio_remote_sensing_occci_nwa_poly4_spring_bloom",
  erddap_url = "https://cioosatlantic.ca/erddap/",
  variables = c("t_start", "t_duration", "amplitude_real", "magnitude_real",
    "annual_mean", "NRMSE_bloom", "percent_dineof"),
  xlim = NULL,
  ylim = NULL,
  timelim = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset_id}{Dataset ID
(default is "bio_remote_sensing_occci_nwa_poly4_spring_bloom",
the satellite ocean colour spring bloom metrics generated by the SOPhyE group at DFO)}

\item{erddap_url}{URL for the ERDDAP server where the data is located
(default is "https://cioosatlantic.ca/erddap/", the CIOOS Atlantic ERDDAP server)}

\item{variables}{vector of variable names to download
(default is the vector of variables in the spring bloom metrics dataset)}

\item{xlim}{Minimum and maximum longitude
(if NULL, downloads the full range of longitudes)}

\item{ylim}{Minimum and maximum latitude
(if NULL, downloads the full range of latitudes)}

\item{timelim}{Start and end datetime string in format "YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z"
(if NULL, downloads the full time series)}
}
\value{
Dataframe with columns longitude, latitude, time, and the selected variables
}
\description{
Downloads satellite ocean colour bloom metrics generated by the SOPhyE team
at DFO from the CIOOS Atlantic ERDDAP (see "Details" for coordinate boundaries
and years for which data is available). Can be used to download other
datasets if the dataset ID and ERDDAP URL is specified.
}
\details{
SOPhyE satellite ocean colour spring bloom metrics:
42-76 degrees west, 39-66 degrees north
1998-2024 (will be updated annually)
Note: Years should be formatted as e.g. "1998-01-01T00:00:00Z" in the "timelim" argument

The satellite bloom metrics downloaded by this function are 4.64 km
resolution and include all the variables in the product at a lower level of
quality control. In contrast, the satellite_ocean_colour variable available
in the marea package is fully quality-controlled and ready to use, excludes
the two quality indicator layers (NRMSE_bloom and percent_dineof), and has
been resampled to 0.1 degree resolution (it is recommended to use the mean
or median of pixel values within this range when working with the original
data, so this is the appropriate resolution to use).
