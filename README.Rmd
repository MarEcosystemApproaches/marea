`marea` provides curated data sets to support an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) in Canada's Maritimes Region. It offers standardized, analysis-ready time series of oceanographic, environmental, and biological data crucial for research and stock assessment.

## Philosophy


1.  **A Single, Simple Data Structure**: All time series data in `marea` are stored in simple and robust `ea`class objects. This provides a consistent, predictable format, whether you are working with temperature, survey indices, or commercial catch.
2.  **User-Controlled Plotting**: We provide a basic, clean plot for every dataset. From there, **you are in control**. Because our plots are standard `ggplot2` objects, you can easily customize them, add new layers, and create the exact visualization you need for your analysis or report.


## Installation

You can install the development version of `marea` from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("MarEcosystemApproaches/marea")
```

For users on the DFO network who may experience connection timeouts:

```r
# Set a longer timeout period
options(timeout = 1200)
remotes::install_github("MarEcosystemApproaches/marea")
```

## Quick Start: A Simple Workflow

The workflow for any dataset in marea is the same: load, inspect, plot, and customize.

```{r}
library(marea)
library(ggplot2) # For customization

# 1. Load a dataset of interest (e.g., grey seal abundance)
data("grey_seals")

# 2. Inspect the object - it's a clean 'ea_data' object
ea.print(grey_seals)

# 3. Create a simple plot
 p <- plot(grey_seals)

```

You can use the style argument to create a default whichis an appropriate base for your 
data, then customize it even further by chaining on ggplot graphics grammar.

```{r}
# 4. Customize it! Add a confidence ribbon and improve the labels.
# The 'low' and 'high' columns are right there in the data frame.
custom_plot <- plot(grey_seals, style = 'ribbon') +
  labs(
   title = "Grey Seal Abundance on Sable Island",
    y = "Estimated Pup Production (count)"
  ) +
  theme_bw()


```

## Available Data

marea includes a growing list of curated data products. Use marea_metadata() to see what's available.

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(marea_metadata())
```

## Documentation
